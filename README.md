TamuHack Hardware hack ControLIT
Rewrite the Arduino firmware to allow keyboard emulation
We were inspired to make this project because we wanted to develop a user experience that will stimulate a lasting interest in and preparation for STEM careers for those under 12 years of age.

This game procedurally teaches kids about Arduino Boards, jumper cables, breadboards, and buttons. It does this by having the kids set up the board and then giving them an explanation as to what they just did and why it works. In this way, it teaches kids about electronics and generates interest in STEM as a whole.

We built the game and the controller at the same time. We then decided which levels would teach the kids which concepts and then set up the button circuits accordingly.
